Al infectar a los humanos con su mordedura, el monstruo puede crear criaturas agresivas y no muertas conocidas como Kabane. En la isla Hinomoto, ubicada en el extremo oriente, las personas han construido estaciones para protegerse de estas criaturas. Las personas acceden a la estación, así como transportan mercancías entre ellas, con la ayuda de una locomotora que funciona con vapor, llamada Hayajiro. Ikoma, un chico que vive en la estación Aragane y ayuda a construir Hayajiro, crea su propia arma llamada Tsuranukizutsu para derrotar a las criaturas. Un día, mientras espera una oportunidad para usar su arma, conoce a una chica llamada Mumei, quien está exenta de la inspección obligatoria de Kabane. Durante la noche, Ikuma se encuentra nuevamente con Mumei cuando ve que Hayajiro está fuera de control. El personal de la locomotora se ha convertido en las criaturas. La estación, ahora bajo ataque de Kabane, es la oportunidad que Ikoma ha estado buscando. (Fuente: MAL News)",

Because of a shift in tectonic plates around 100 years ago, Japan lost much of its area to submergence. To preserve Japan's territories, coastal cities sprung up, one after the other. Eventually, they became marine cities, and along with the expansion of sea-lanes to connect them, the need arose for a sizable staff to protect the seas. At the same time, maritime jobs were becoming more popular among women. Hence, the Blue Mermaids, tasked with keeping the seas safe, had become every female student's dream job.

However, many Promin who have turned into bugs known as \"Bugmin\" are responsible for many of the world's real-life bugs. Left alone, they may eventually turn into a big problem. The boy Yuuto encounters the space dog Wanda, and the pair use a camera-like device and key items to capture Bugmin. Promin themselves are able to do things like \"accelerate objects,\" \"spew fire,\" or \"create objects,\" through an ability known as \"Kamiwaza\" (miracle), and are able to fend off Bugmin with it. At first, the Bugmin only cause small, bothersome things, but it will soon elevate into a global scale threat. Can one boy and one dog save the world? (Source: ANN)",
