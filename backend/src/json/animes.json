Al infectar a los humanos con su mordedura, el monstruo puede crear criaturas agresivas y no muertas conocidas como Kabane. En la isla Hinomoto, ubicada en el extremo oriente, las personas han construido estaciones para protegerse de estas criaturas. Las personas acceden a la estación, así como transportan mercancías entre ellas, con la ayuda de una locomotora que funciona con vapor, llamada Hayajiro. Ikoma, un chico que vive en la estación Aragane y ayuda a construir Hayajiro, crea su propia arma llamada Tsuranukizutsu para derrotar a las criaturas. Un día, mientras espera una oportunidad para usar su arma, conoce a una chica llamada Mumei, quien está exenta de la inspección obligatoria de Kabane. Durante la noche, Ikuma se encuentra nuevamente con Mumei cuando ve que Hayajiro está fuera de control. El personal de la locomotora se ha convertido en las criaturas. La estación, ahora bajo ataque de Kabane, es la oportunidad que Ikoma ha estado buscando. (Fuente: MAL News)",

Promin themselves are able to do things like \"accelerate objects,\" \"spew fire,\" or \"create objects,\" through an ability known as \"Kamiwaza\" (miracle), and are able to fend off Bugmin with it. At first, the Bugmin only cause small, bothersome things, but it will soon elevate into a global scale threat. Can one boy and one dog save the world? (Source: ANN)",
